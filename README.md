Hey,

Practicing my HTML/CSS properties again. Keeping up with my commitment to upload a project daily (or one every two days depending how large this project is).

In this project, I attempted to clone the beginning of the webpage Illumina (big fan!). I have uploaded a previous version a few weeks to a month ago, and am happy to see how far I progressed. I hope to continually improve.
